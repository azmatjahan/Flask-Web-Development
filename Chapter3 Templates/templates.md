<h1>Chapter3 Templates</h1>

<p>Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is a file that contains the text of
a response, with placeholder variables for the dynamic parts that will be known only in the context of a request. </p>
<p>The process that replaces the variables with actual values and returns a
final response string is called rendering. For the task of rendering templates,
Flask uses a powerful template engine called Jinja2.
A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates. </p>
